# Currencies

In our API, we frequently call for a currency as an input or output. We represent all such currencies and stores of value by a three letter code. In our Knowledge Base you will always find the most recent and up-to-date [list of the currencies we support](https://support.bitreserve.org/hc/en-us/articles/202473803), along with the three letter abbreviation you can use when referring to the currency within our API.
